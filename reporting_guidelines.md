# Reporting Guidelines

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct (https://github.com/yyjtech/code-of-conduct) we ask that you report
it to the YYJ Tech community leaders here: https://goo.gl/forms/94uxzsNnwDLIotQ23

**All reports will be kept confidential.** In some cases we may determine that a
public statement will need to be made. If that’s the case, the identities of all
victims and reporters will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct
us otherwise.

If you believe anyone is in physical danger, please notify appropriate law
enforcement first. If you are unsure what law enforcement agency is appropriate,
please include this in your report and we will attempt to notify them.

If you included personal contact information, you will receive an email from the YYJ Tech community leaders acknowledging
receipt within 24 hours (and will aim for much quicker than that).

The working group will immediately meet to review the incident and determine:

* What happened.
* Whether this event constitutes a code of conduct violation.
* Who the bad actor was.
* Whether this is an ongoing situation, or if there is a threat to anyone’s
  physical safety.

If this is determined to be an ongoing incident or a threat to physical safety,
the working groups’ immediate priority will be to protect everyone involved.
This means we may delay an "official" response until we believe that the
situation has ended and that everyone is physically safe.

Once the working group has a complete account of the events they will make a
decision as to how to respond. Responses may include:

* Nothing (if we determine no violation occurred).
* A private reprimand from the working group to the individual(s) involved.
* A public reprimand.
* An imposed vacation (i.e. asking someone to "take a week off" from a mailing
  list or IRC).
* A permanent or temporary ban from some or all YYJTech spaces (events, meetings,
  mailing lists, Slack, etc.)
* A request for a public or private apology.
* A request to engage in mediation and/or an accountability plan.
* We’ll respond within one week to the person who filed the report with either a
  resolution, or an explanation of why the situation is not yet resolved.

Once we’ve determined our final action, we’ll contact the original reporter to
let them know what action (if any) we’ll be taking. We’ll take into account
feedback from the reporter on the appropriateness of our response, but we don’t
guarantee we’ll act on it.

### Appealing

Only permanent resolutions (such as bans) may be appealed. To appeal a decision
of the working group, contact community organizers (@brandonbrown @jtrill @jen @laurac @maypong @jem @moxus) with your appeal and we will review the case.
