# YYJ Tech Code of Conduct

YYJ Tech strives to be as equitible and inclusive as possible. This code of conduct sets the expectations and guidelines for all members on how to conduct themselves to create a community that is as welcoming and inclusive as possible, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

However, we are all humans, and we know that there are times that we will not get things right. 

Help us out by sharing things you are concerned about here. You can find more information about how to do that in the [Reporting Guidelines](https://github.com/yyjtech/code-of-conduct/blob/master/reporting_guidelines.md).


## 1\. Purpose

A primary goal of YYJ Tech is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

We invite all those who participate in the YYJ Tech community to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## 2\. Open Tech Citizenship

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open tech citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to celebrate and support that.

## 3\. Expected Behavior

We have three main expecations for community behaviours that contribute to creating a welcoming and thriving community. These are goals and aspirations to help drive us beyond just what is "ok" or "legal" and towards what is actively making our community a more welcoming place. 

> Behave as if you were at a professional event
Although we are on the internet - and perhaps even more importantly _because_ we are on the internet where tone is extra challenging to read - choosing our words carefully and conducting yourself as a professional is important. 

> Use kindness to build community
This doesn't mean we don't hold each other to high standards for behaviour, but it does mean we call each other out or in on things we are uncomfortable with in a way that is grounded in empathy and respect - even if we don't feel like we ourselves were respected in that moment. 

> Be curious to hear about the other personâ€™s perspective
When you find yourself struggling to communicate with another group member, it's time to take a step back. Try repeating back to the other person what you think you heard them say, and give them a chance to clarify. Ask them to do the same for you. 

> We all have to help to foster safer and braver spaces
Figuring out how to include someone who does not have the same experience as you is not easy, and if we succeed in being a welcoming place that will mean we are interacting with many more people with many diverse experiences. Don't be afraid to try, but be open to feedback and don't take offense if someone asks you to do something differently to include them. Work together to find a way to make it possible. 


| Situation |  Not acceptable | Why this is not ideal | Better options |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| You see someone you want to connect with, but you don't already know or have a good relationship with 
| You send them a message asking for something from them, and keep messaging them until they respond
| Think of a DM like invading someone's personal space - ask politely to be invited in, like you would coming into a home or how you might introduce yourself at an in-person networking event before starting to talk.
| - Reply to the thread where you initially ran across them, and ask if they would like to connect via DM or LinkedIn <br> - Ask someone you mutually know to introduct you <br> - Request to add them on LinkedIn <br> - Start your message with "Hello, I hope it's ok to reach out via DM..."|
| You see a post that you're not sure is on topic for the group, and you're extra suspicious because this person doesn't seem to be on a BC timezone 
| Ask "is this Victoria related?" or "Are you from Victoria"?
| Many people use this Slack group as a way of seeking employment to come to Victoria or Canada, not only because they already live here. Reacting this way makes people feel unwelcomed in the community. Imagine coming to a public event and being asked "do you belong here?" - that wouldn't feel great. |
| - Welcome! What are you hoping to get out of this group?" Perhaps you can direct them to the right resources, or clear up confusion about the purpose of the community if there is any <br> - Type `!welcome` to trigger a welcome message that can help guide to find the part of the community they are looking for <br> - Hello! It looks like you aren't currently located in Victoria. Are you planning to move here? You should check out https://www.movingtovictoria.com/ - it's a great resource curated by one of our community members. |
| You see a community member or organization behaving in a way that you don't like | 

> Pro tip: Imagine someone in your family or friend group who's got your back, but holds you to high standards - whether that be your grandma, your cousin, our best friend or your mom - would they be cheering on what you're about to say, or would they be disappointed in your level of professionalism? 



The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

* Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
* Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions. Tone on the internet is often misunderstood, and people may interpret your words differently than you might intend. So err on the side of caution.
* Attempt collaboration before conflict.
* Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
* Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
* Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

## 4\. Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community. This is not an exhaustive list of unacceptable behaviour.

* Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
* Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
* Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
* Posting or threatening to post other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
* Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
* Inappropriate photography or recording.
* Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone's consent before touching them.
* Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
* Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.

### Spam

As a local community, promoting of things unrelated to Victoria, BC is often considered spam and the community is very sensitive to this. 

* DMing members to promote things is *not* allowed. Users who do this will be warned, and failure to stop will result in having your account suspended.
* Posting to promote things unrelated to Victoria, BC or with no clear benefit to the community *will be removed*. Users who do this will be warned, and failure to stop will result in having your account suspended. For example:
  * Sharing an app or website where the content is not related to Victoria, BC or nearby local area is *not* allowed. 
  * Promoting other general tech resources (e.g. websites for finding work, tools, apps) is *not* allowed. 

These things are acceptable within the community standards:
* Events and job postings that are on-topic for the technology industry and are possible to attend remotely or have a clear benefit to members of the community (e.g. access to funding) are allowed. 
* Self-promotion is permitted in #shameless-self-promotion, provided it meets the above criteria of being related to Victoria (e.g. built by a member of the Victoria or nearby tech community).

## 5\. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).

## 6\. Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible by emailing Marie (marie.starck @ shaw dot ca) or Jessica (jess.rae.thomas @ gmail dot com).

See our [Reporting Guidelines](https://github.com/yyjtech/code-of-conduct/blob/master/reporting_guidelines.md) for more details.

Additionally, community organizers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.

## 7\. Addressing Grievances

Only permanent resolutions (such as bans) may be appealed. To appeal a decision of the community leadership, contact the community organizers (Marie or Jessica) and we will review the case.

## 8\. Scope

We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venuesâ€“online and in-personâ€“as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.

This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occuring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.
